' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to implement hot-track for grid rows during the drag-and-drop operation
' 
' This example illustrates how to highlight rows during the drag-and-drop
' operation. In this example, we have DependencyProperty at the Window class level
' that stores a current row handle of a row over which the mouse is.
' To obtain a
' current row handle, we use the DragOver event. Also, it is necessary to define
' RowStyle and add a trigger that will compare the current row handle with a
' dependency property value and change the current row's background if necessary.
